# Streamlit-WebRTC

**Real-time video and audio processing in Streamlit apps** âœ¨

Transform your Streamlit applications with live video and audio streams. `streamlit-webrtc` bridges the gap between web browsers and Python, enabling real-time media processing with WebRTC technology.

## âœ¨ What You Can Build

- **Live video filters** - Apply computer vision transformations in real-time
- **Audio analysis apps** - Process microphone input with machine learning
- **Interactive demos** - Create engaging ML showcases with live camera feeds
- **Real-time pipelines** - Build production-ready streaming applications

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```python
--8<-- "./examples/quick_start.py"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect For

- **ML Engineers** building interactive demos
- **Researchers** prototyping computer vision applications
- **Developers** creating real-time web experiences
- **Educators** teaching with live examples
